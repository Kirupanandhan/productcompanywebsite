            DCT was founded on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800.
             It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, 
             followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO)
             ,
             <br/>
             and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. 
             Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions
             , their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016
             , followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.
             <br/>

            As of 2015, DCT is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market,
             although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.
              The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing),
               the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development.
